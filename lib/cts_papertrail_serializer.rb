      where_object_changes no longer supports reading YAML from a text
      column. The old implementation was inaccurate, returning more records
      than you wanted. This feature was deprecated in 8.1.0 and removed in
      9.0.0. The json and jsonb datatypes are still supported. See
      discussion at https://github.com/airblade/paper_trail/pull/997
